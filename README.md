## Install

npm i @edanchenkov/react-d3-graph
```

## Usage sample

Graph component is the main component for react-d3-graph components, its interface allows its user to build the graph once the user provides the data, configuration (optional) and callback interactions (also optional).
The code for the [live example](https://danielcaldas.github.io/react-d3-graph/sandbox/index.html) can be consulted [here](https://github.com/danielcaldas/react-d3-graph/blob/master/sandbox/Sandbox.jsx).

```javascript
import { Graph } from 'react-d3-graph';

// graph payload (with minimalist structure)
const data = {
    nodes: [{ id: 'Harry' }, { id: 'Sally' }, { id: 'Alice' }],
    links: [{ source: 'Harry', target: 'Sally' }, { source: 'Harry', target: 'Alice' }]
};

// the graph configuration, you only need to pass down properties
// that you want to override, otherwise default ones will be used
const myConfig = {
    nodeHighlightBehavior: true,
    node: {
        color: 'lightgreen',
        size: 120,
        highlightStrokeColor: 'blue'
    },
    link: {
        highlightColor: 'lightblue'
    }
};

// graph event callbacks
const onClickGraph = function() {
    window.alert(`Clicked the graph background`);
};

const onClickNode = function(nodeId) {
    window.alert(`Clicked node ${nodeId}`);
};

const onRightClickNode = function(event, nodeId) {
    window.alert(`Right clicked node ${nodeId}`);
};

const onMouseOverNode = function(nodeId) {
    window.alert(`Mouse over node ${nodeId}`);
};

const onMouseOutNode = function(nodeId) {
    window.alert(`Mouse out node ${nodeId}`);
};

const onClickLink = function(source, target) {
    window.alert(`Clicked link between ${source} and ${target}`);
};

const onRightClickLink = function(event, source, target) {
    window.alert(`Right clicked link between ${source} and ${target}`);
};

const onMouseOverLink = function(source, target) {
    window.alert(`Mouse over in link between ${source} and ${target}`);
};

const onMouseOutLink = function(source, target) {
    window.alert(`Mouse out link between ${source} and ${target}`);
};

<Graph
    id="graph-id" // id is mandatory, if no id is defined rd3g will throw an error
    data={data}
    config={myConfig}
    onClickNode={onClickNode}
    onRightClickNode={onRightClickNode}
    onClickGraph={onClickGraph}
    onClickLink={onClickLink}
    onRightClickLink={onRightClickLink}
    onMouseOverNode={onMouseOverNode}
    onMouseOutNode={onMouseOutNode}
    onMouseOverLink={onMouseOverLink}
    onMouseOutLink={onMouseOutLink}
/>;
```
